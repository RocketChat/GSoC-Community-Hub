# Google Summer of Code Community Hub

An easy to use, ready-for-customization, community engagement and management system specially designed for Google Summer of Code communities.

## Technical Synopsis

A fully componentized (not page-based as in nextjs) scalable web app, with a set of tested full-stack configurable GSoC-friendly components, ready to be customized for your GSoC community.

Full stack components are components that may encapsulate server-side behaviors in addition to client-side/UI behaviors.

This system can be configured (layout of pages based on components;  and parameterization of the components) via a specially designed DSL.   

This DSL will facilitate the creation of a near-future "drag-and-drop what-you-see-is-what-you-get" GUI layout tool;  as well as AI prompt based generation of entire community websites.

Currently, the system is built based on [Svelte 5](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte).  Layout is powered by [bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).  Runtime is [bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun).

## Developing

The system is superbly lightweight yet runs across all OS and environments.

First, install bun.   It should take 2 minutes.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Customize  the environment variables:

```bash
cp sample.env.local  .env.local
nano  .env.local
```

To start a development server, with a browser on the app's home page:

```bash
bun run dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your system:

```bash
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.


##  Components Ecosystem

The following independent components are available.&ensp; They are located under the `./src/lib/components` directory.&ensp; Many more components are being created/ported. &ensp;  Configuration and parameterization are documented on their own doc page.
