# Google Summer of Code Community Hub

An easy to use, ready-for-customization, community engagement and management system specially designed for Google Summer of Code communities.

## Technical Synopsis

A fully componentized (not page-based as in nextjs) scalable web app, with a set of tested full-stack configurable GSoC-friendly components, ready to be customized for your GSoC community.

Full stack components are components that may encapsulate server-side behaviors in addition to client-side/UI behaviors.

This system can be configured (layout of pages based on components; and parameterization of the components) via a specially designed DSL.

The way the Domain Specific Language works is simple;

- Specify imports using `use X from module`
- Get component data using the `get` syntax
- Specify page layout by placing components inside of the `<main></main>` tag

This DSL will facilitate the creation of a near-future drag-and-drop "what-you-see-is-what-you-get" GUI layout tool; as well as AI prompt based generation of entire community websites. For a more thorough rundown, its creator provides a excellent [summary](https://github.com/anjy7/Google-Summer-of-Code).

Currently, the system is built based on [Svelte 5](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte). Layout is powered by [bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap). Runtime is [bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun).

## Developing

The system is superbly lightweight yet runs across all OS and environments.

First, install bun. It should take 2 minutes.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Customize the environment variables:

```bash
cp sample.env.local  .env.local
nano  .env.local
```

To generate specified pages via the DSL (these will be found in `./src/routes`):

```bash
bun run compile
```

To start a development server, with a browser on the app's home page:

```bash
bun run dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your system:

```bash
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.

## What is an `.agml` file?

In a nutshell, `.agml` files represent our **domain-specific language (DSL)** designed to simplify the creation of Svelte pages. The syntax is intentionally minimal and easy to learn, with just a few conventions to follow:

- **`i` (install)**: Installs a specified package from a registry (e.g., `npm`).  
  _Note: Since all components are currently available in `lib/components`, this command is optional and can usually be skipped._

- **`use`**: Imports specific components or modules from the package.

- **`get`**: Fetches and binds data that will be passed as props to components.

- The rest of the page content should be enclosed within a `<main></main>` block.

## Components Ecosystem

The following independent components are available.&ensp; They are located under the `./src/lib/components` directory.&ensp; Many more components are being created/ported. &ensp; Configuration and parameterization are documented on their own doc page.
